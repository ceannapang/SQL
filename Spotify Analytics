# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQLs. 

--Which artist had the most songs in the top 50?
SELECT artist_name, count(artist_name) AS song_count
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY song_count DESC

--How many songs were longer than 2 minutes and had a popularity greater than 90?
SELECT count(track_name)

WHERE duration_ms > 120000 AND popularity>90;

--What was the average danceability for songs with a tempo under 100?
SELECT AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE tempo < 100;

---Which Olivia Rodrigo song had the highest acoustic?
SELECT track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo'
ORDER BY acousticness DESC
LIMIT 1;

--How many of each type of song key was used?
SELECT count(DISTINCT song_key)

--Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
--Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
