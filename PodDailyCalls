/* Here I worked with a dataset called Pod Daily Calls which explored orthopedic daily call volume data sorted by pods (two speciality service lines combined). 
There are three pods; Upper Extremity & Sports, Total Joint & Oncology and Foot/Ankle & Trauma.
Using this data, I determined average hold times, abandoned call rates and call volume comparing findings from 2022 to 2023. *\
